# serialservo-server

This module will provide a restful service endpoint to the serialservo module.

## Install

```bash
npm install serialservo-server
```

## Typical Usage

Just add the following and run it.

```javascript
var SerialServoServer = require("serialservo-server");

Alternately you can work with options to override defaults.

```javascript
var SerialServoServer = require("serialservo-server");
var configOptions = { 
                        httpPort: 9090, 
                        loggingEnabled: false, 
                        portName: '/dev/ttyUSB1', 
                        serialPortOptions: { 
                            baudRate: 9600
                        },
                        staticDir: 'somedirector',
                        httpPort: 3000
                    };
var sscServer = new SerialServoServer(configOptions);
sscServer.run();
```
